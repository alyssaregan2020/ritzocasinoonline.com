                    <h2 class="mt-5">1. Our Commitment to Player Safety and Well-Being</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to our website. Our primary mission is to provide clear, helpful, and accurate information about the <span class="accent-keyword">Ritzo Casino online</span> platform. While we focus on the features and entertainment value of online gaming, we are profoundly committed to promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>
                    <p>We believe that gambling should always be a safe, enjoyable, and controlled form of entertainment. It should never negatively impact a person's finances, health, or relationships. This policy outlines our dedication to player well-being by providing information, promoting awareness of potential risks, and directing users to professional help and resources available in Canada and internationally.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mt-5">2. The Role and Limitations of Our Website</h2>
                    <p>It is essential for all visitors to understand the function of our Site.</p>
                    <p>We are an independent informational resource. We are NOT an online casino operator and we do not offer or facilitate any gambling services.</p>
                    <p>This means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We do not accept wagers, bets, or any form of payment for gambling.</li>
                        <li>We do not process financial transactions related to online casino play.</li>
                        <li>The information on our Site, including guides on how to play online at gaming platforms, is for informational and educational purposes only.</li>
                        <li>Any links to the <span class="accent-keyword">Ritzo online casino</span> platform or other third-party sites are provided as informational resources. We strongly encourage all users to review the responsible gambling policies of any third-party site they visit.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2 class="mt-5">3. Key Principles of Responsible Gambling</h2>
                    <p>To ensure your gaming experience remains a positive one, we strongly advocate for the following principles of safe play:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gamble for Entertainment, Not as a Financial Solution:</strong> Treat gambling as a leisure activity with a cost, similar to attending a concert or a sporting event. It is not a reliable source of income or a way to solve financial problems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Only Play with Funds You Can Afford to Lose:</strong> Never use money that is intended for essential expenses like rent, bills, or groceries. Establish a clear entertainment budget and stick to it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Set Clear Time and Money Limits:</strong> Before you start playing on any gaming platform, decide on a maximum amount of money and a maximum amount of time you are willing to spend. Once you reach either limit, stop playing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Never Chase Your Losses:</strong> It can be tempting to try to win back money you have lost, but this often leads to greater losses. Accept losses as part of the game.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid Gambling When Emotional or Impaired:</strong> Your judgment can be compromised when you are feeling stressed, upset, anxious, or are under the influence of alcohol. Do not use gambling as a way to cope with life's difficulties.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balance Gambling with Other Activities:</strong> Ensure that gaming is just one of many hobbies in a balanced lifestyle. It should not interfere with your work, family life, social activities, or other interests.</li>
                        <li><strong>Understand How Games Work:</strong> Be aware that the outcomes of casino games are based on chance and are determined by a Random Number Generator (RNG). There is no system that can guarantee a win.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">4. Recognizing the Signs of Problem Gambling</h2>
                    <p>Problem gambling can affect anyone. Being aware of the warning signs in yourself or in someone you care about is a crucial first step. Please consider the following questions honestly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you spending more time or money on gambling than you originally planned?</li>
                        <li>Do you find yourself constantly thinking about gambling?</li>
                        <li>Have you ever lied to family, friends, or colleagues to hide the extent of your gambling?</li>
                        <li>Have you neglected responsibilities at work, school, or home because of gambling?</li>
                        <li>Have you ever borrowed money or sold personal items to fund your gambling?</li>
                        <li>Do you feel guilty, anxious, or depressed after a gambling session?</li>
                        <li>Do you use gambling as a way to escape from problems or relieve negative feelings?</li>
                        <li>Do you feel an urge to increase your bet sizes to achieve the same level of excitement?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions, it could be a sign that you are at risk. Recognizing this is a sign of strength, and we strongly encourage you to seek confidential support.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-5">5. Protection of Minors</h2>
                    <p>Our website and the information on it are strictly intended for an adult audience. Users must be 19 years of age or older (the legal age for gambling in most Canadian provinces) or the legal age in their specific jurisdiction.</p>
                    <p>We do not knowingly create content to attract minors. We urge parents and guardians to be proactive in their children's online safety. Please consider using parental control and filtering software to block access to gambling-related content. Tools like Net Nanny, CyberPatrol, and Qustodio can be effective resources.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="mt-5">6. Where to Find Help and Support in Canada</h2>
                    <p>If you are concerned about your gambling habits, please know that you are not alone and that free, professional, and confidential help is readily available. The following organizations are highly respected and offer excellent support for Canadian residents:</p>
