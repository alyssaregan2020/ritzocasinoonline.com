They are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                            <p>Cookies can be set by the website owner ("first-party cookies") or by parties other than the website owner ("third-party cookies").</p>
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These are temporary and are deleted from your device when you close your browser.</li>
                                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> These remain on your device for a set period or until you manually delete them.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">3. How and Why We Use Cookies</h2>
                            <p>We use cookies for several important reasons, all aimed at improving your experience on our site. Our primary uses for cookies are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>To Ensure Website Functionality:</strong> Some cookies are essential for the technical operation of our website. They help with basic functions like page navigation and ensuring the site is secure.</li>
                                <li><strong>To Analyze and Improve Our Site:</strong> We use analytics cookies to collect anonymous information about how visitors use our website. This helps us understand which pages are most popular (e.g., our guides on how to play online at the gaming platform), how users navigate the site, and if they encounter any errors. This aggregated data allows us to make data-driven improvements to our content and layout.</li>
                                <li><strong>To Enhance Your Experience:</strong> Functionality cookies allow us to remember your preferences (such as language or region) to provide a more personalized experience on future visits.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2 class="h3 mt-5">4. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

                            <h3 class="h4 mt-4">d) Targeting / Affiliate Cookies</h3>
                            <p>Our site may contain affiliate links to third-party websites, such as the official <span class="accent-keyword">Ritzo online casino</span> .
